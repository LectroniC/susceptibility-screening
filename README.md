# UIUC CS598DLH Reproducibility Project


## [Identify Susceptible Locations in Medical Records via Adversarial Attacks on Deep Predictive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04822)


## Introduction

This project is to reproduce [Identify Susceptible Locations in Medical Records via Adversarial Attacks on Deep Predictive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04822). The code would be added soon.

To train the LSTM model mentioned in the paper, you can use the following sampled data.
You would need an @illinois.edu to access the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPwtfLnRe4bgKQ439eANFxKDvnkzgDNH/view?usp=sharing).

## Project Layout
- [mimic3gen](../mimic3gen): This folder contains our data cleaning and extraction efforts. 
- train_lstm.py: Train the LSTM model.
